          <p>The safety and se­cu­rity of your in­for­ma­tion also de­pends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have cho­sen) a pass­word for ac­cess to cer­tain parts of our Ser­vice, you are re­spon­si­ble for keep­ing this pass­word con­fi­den­tial. We ask you not to share your pass­word with any­one. We urge you to be care­ful about giv­ing out in­for­ma­tion in pub­lic areas of the Ser­vice like mes­sage boards. The in­for­ma­tion you share in pub­lic areas may be viewed by any user of the Ser­vice.</p>
          <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the trans­mis­sion of in­for­ma­tion via the in­ter­net is not com­pletely se­cure. Al­though we do our best to pro­tect your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, we can­not guar­an­tee the se­cu­rity of your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion trans­mit­ted to our Ser­vice. Any trans­mis­sion of per­sonal in­for­ma­tion is at your own risk. We are not re­spon­si­ble for cir­cum­ven­tion of any pri­vacy set­tings or se­cu­rity mea­sures con­tained on the Ser­vice.</p>

          <h3>International Transfer of Information</h3>
          <p>Your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion will not be dis­closed out­side the Com­pany or out­side third par­ties op­er­at­ing for us to main­tain and de­velop the Ser­vice. How­ever, the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion may be dis­closed to a third party dur­ing a ne­go­ti­a­tion of any merger or ac­qui­si­tion and the re­ceiv­ing party has un­der­taken to fol­low non-dis­clo­sure li­a­bil­i­ties with re­spect to the dis­closed in­for­ma­tion.</p>
          <p>Only the nec­es­sary per­sonal in­for­ma­tion is shared with the above-men­tioned third par­ties. Your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion may also be dis­closed to au­thor­i­ties in cases re­quired by the law or per­mit­ted by ap­plic­a­ble law or reg­u­la­tion or con­sented by you.</p>
          <p>In ad­di­tion, We may also share gen­eral, de­mo­graphic or ag­gre­gated in­for­ma­tion with third par­ties about the users and the cus­tomers and the usage of web­sites, ser­vices and prod­ucts, but that in­for­ma­tion will not in­clude or be linked to any of your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion with­out your con­sent.</p>
          <p>If you are lo­cated in the United States or other re­gions out­side the Eu­ro­pean Union with laws gov­ern­ing data col­lec­tion and use that may dif­fer from the EU pri­vacy and data pro­tec­tion laws, please note that you might trans­fer in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, to a coun­try and ju­ris­dic­tion that might not have the same data pro­tec­tion laws as your ju­ris­dic­tion, and you con­sent to the trans­fer of in­for­ma­tion and the use and dis­clo­sure of in­for­ma­tion about you, in­clud­ing per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, as de­scribed in this pol­icy.</p>
