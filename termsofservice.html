All changes are ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately when we post them, and apply to all ac­cess to and use of the Ser­vice there­after. How­ever, any changes to the dis­pute res­o­lu­tion pro­vi­sions set forth in Gov­ern­ing Law and Ju­ris­dic­tion will not apply to any dis­putes for which the par­ties have ac­tual no­tice on or prior to the date the change is posted on the Ser­vice.</p>

          <h3>Accessing the Service and Account Security</h3>
          <p>We re­serve the right to with­draw or amend the Ser­vice, and any ser­vice or ma­te­r­ial we pro­vide on the Ser­vice, in our sole dis­cre­tion with­out no­tice. We will not be li­able if for any rea­son all or any part of the Ser­vice is un­avail­able at any time or for any pe­riod. From time to time, we may re­strict ac­cess to some parts of the Ser­vice (in­clud­ing any web­site or any game/app), in­clud­ing to reg­is­tered users.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for:</p>

          </ul>

You should use par­tic­u­lar cau­tion when ac­cess­ing your ac­count from a pub­lic or shared com­puter so that oth­ers are not able to view or record your pass­word or other per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
          <p>We have the right to dis­able any user name, pass­word or other iden­ti­fier, whether cho­sen by you or pro­vided by us, at any time in our sole dis­cre­tion for any or no rea­son, in­clud­ing if, in our opin­ion, you have vi­o­lated any pro­vi­sion of these Terms of Ser­vice.</p>
